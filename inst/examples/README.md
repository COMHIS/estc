# Analysis

[main.R](main.R) is the main script which runs the preprocessing
workflow.


# Data sets

Request access to [Aalto Gitlab](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/) <Contact: [Leo Lahti](http://www.iki.fi/Leo.Lahti)>

Clone the [estc](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/comhis/estc) and
[ecco](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/comhis/ecco) repositories.

Retrieve the following data set/s
 * [ecco2.json.gz](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/comhis/ecco/blob/master/originals/ecco2.json.gz)

All other data sets that the script calls can be newly generated by
uncommenting out relevant parts in the scripts, and the commenting
them out again. These files are located in
gitlab/comhis/estc/unified/polished, and include:

 * df.Rds
 * df.raw.Rds
 


# Preparation 

The data/ folder called by the script refers to the Gitlab folder
estc/unified/ - the preprocessed data can be updated in there.
