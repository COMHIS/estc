# Data sets

Request access to [Aalto Gitlab](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/) <Contact: [Leo Lahti](http://www.iki.fi/Leo.Lahti)>

Clone the [estc](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/comhis/estc) and
[ecco](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/comhis/ecco) repositories.

Retrieve the following data set/s
 * [ecco2.json.gz](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/comhis/ecco/blob/master/originals/ecco2.json.gz)

All other data sets that the script calls can be newly generated by
uncommenting out relevant parts in the scripts, and the commenting
them out again. These are not maintained in the Gitlab repositories as
they are not original source files.
